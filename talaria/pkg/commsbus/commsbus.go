/*
	Right - I'm not really sure what the comms bus is right now or what it looks like. It
	might be its own discrete component, or it might be the output of the transaction engine,
	I'm not sure and I don't think it matters at this rev other than knowing that there is
	something which is producing events.

	This module is mostly being used as a means to push data through the transport flow and
	show that that the rest of Talaria runtime is working as expected.

	We're cutting some corners here:

	 - The Comms bus exposes an API /message that when hit with a JSON payload, calls through
	   to talaria and starts the message send flow.
	 - I'd expect that whatever the comms bus is, is initialised with a reference to the
	   Talaria runtime, we're using that concept here but it won't look like this when we
		 actually initialise talaria
