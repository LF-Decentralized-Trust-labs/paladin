// TODO: More work on algorithm taxonomy. These could become very dynamic strings,
// as we specify complex dynamic payloads for ZKP proof generation
// (with signing key access during the proof generation stage).

// For now however, it's extremely simple - we just need one:
// - ECDSA algorithm
// - SECP256K1 curve
// - Plain bytes-in, bytes-out (caller is responsible for generating/formatting/hashing the payload such as Eth TX at some version, or EIP-712 etc. prior to signing)
