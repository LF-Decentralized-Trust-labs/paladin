# Tutorials

Welcome to the Paladin tutorials! These tutorials provide a comprehensive introduction to running Paladin, starting with basic concepts and progressing to advanced privacy-preserving  applications.

## Prerequisites

- **Git**  
- **Node.js 20.x or newer**  
  Follow the [official Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for your platform to install the appropriate version.

⚠️ To ensure you are using a stable version, **always clone the most recent release tag**:

```shell
REPO=https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/paladin.git
TAG=$(git ls-remote --tags $REPO | cut -d/ -f3 | grep -v '\-rc' | sort -V | tail -n1)
git clone $REPO -b $TAG
```

## Next Steps

The tutorials on this page provide an introduction to building on the Paladin platform. If you haven't already, visit the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started/installation.md) to familiarize yourself with running Paladin before proceeding with any of the tutorials below.

## Learning Path

The tutorials are designed to be completed in sequence, with each building upon the concepts introduced in previous tutorials:

1. **Foundation** - Start with Hello World and Public Storage to understand basic Paladin operations
2. **Privacy** - Move to Private Storage to learn about privacy groups and confidential contracts
3. **Tokens** - Explore Notarized Tokens for controlled, auditable token operations
4. **Advanced Privacy** - Dive into ZKP-based privacy with the CBDC and Stablecoin tutorials
5. **Integration** - Learn atomic operations and complex workflows with Atomic Swap and Bond Issuance
