## Programmable privacy for EVM

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) powers over 80% of global blockchain projects, making it the 'de facto'
runtime environment for both enterprise and permissionless networks.

However, there are requirements for enterprise use cases that are not met by the core standard
of EVM. The Paladin project brings latest generation of innovation in solving these requirements in the
EVM ecosystem, and provides a comprehensive enterprise grade Apache 2.0 open source stack to deliver them.
