	// The caller should assume this could involve I/O and hence might block the calling routine.
	// However, how much actual I/O is performed in-line with the function call is transport plugin dependent.

	// The transport tries to feedback failure when it is immediate, but the transport has no guarantees
	// on delivery, and the target failing to process the message should be considered a possible
