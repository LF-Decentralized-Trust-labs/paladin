	//Super simple algorithm for fair (across senders) selection algorithm that biases against transaction from a sender that is unresponsive or has been tending to assemble transactions that are not getting endorsed
	//Transactions get added to the queue when they enter the State_Pooled state
	// given that only one transaction per sender can enter the State_Pooled state at a time, this gives us some natural fairness

	//There is a fast queue and a slow queue
	// when a transaction fails to assemble due to sender timeout, or if it fails endorsement, the error count is incremented and it is placed at the end of the slow queue

	//NOTE This algorithm currently only biases against the current transaction for each faulty sender.  As soon as that transaction is successful, the next transaction from the same sender is treated just like any other transaction.
