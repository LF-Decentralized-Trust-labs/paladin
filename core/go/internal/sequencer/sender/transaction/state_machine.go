	//TODO currently Pending doesn't really make sense as a state because it is an instantaneous state.  It is the state of the transaction when it is first created and then immediately transitions to Delegated.
	// States only really make sense when the transaction is waiting for something to happen.  We could remove this state and just have the transaction start in the Delegated state
	// However, there may be a need for the sender to only delegate a subset of the transactions ( e.g. maybe there is an absolute ordering requirement and the only way to achieve that is by holding back until the dependency is confirmed)
	// It is also slightly complicated by the fact that the delegation request is sent by an action of the sender state machine because it sends the delegation request for multiple transactions at once.
	// Need a decision point on whether that is done by a) transaction emitting and event that triggers the sender to send the delegation request or b) the transaction state machine action makes a syncronous call to the sender to include that transaction in a new delegation request.
	// NOTE: initially there was a thought that we needed a pending state in case there is no current active coordinator so we can't go straight to delegated.  However, the current model is that we don't actually wait for any response from the coordinator.  We simply send the delegation request and assume that it is delegated at that point.
