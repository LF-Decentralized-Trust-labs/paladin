		// TODO think about where the following comment should go.  THere is a lot of rationale documented here that is relevant to other parts of the code

		// Another explanation for this is that it is one of our transactions but we see the confirmation event before
		//  we see the coordinator's heartbeat telling us that it has been submitted with the given hash.
		// In normal operation, we will eventually see a coordinator heartbeat telling us that the transaction has been confirmed
		// In abnormal operation ( coordinator goes down or network partition ) then we might end up sending the transaction to the new coordinator.
		// Eventually, if the transaction submission from the old coordinator or the new, then we will see a blockchain event confirming transaction success
		//   and that event will have the transaction ID so even if we never see the submitted hash, we can break out of the retry loop.
		// In the meantime, it would be safe albeit possibly inefficient to delegate all unconfirmed transactions
