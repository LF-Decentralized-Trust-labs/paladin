# Example: Bond Issuance

This example demonstrates a private bond issuance, where a company can raise capital from investors in a privacy-preserving manner. It uses Noto for both the cash and bond tokens, Pente for private logic, and Atom for the atomic settlement of the bond purchase.

See the [tutorial](https://lf-decentralized-trust-labs.github.io/paladin/head/tutorials/bond-issuance/) for a detailed explanation.
