# Example: Atomic Swap

This example demonstrates an atomic swap of a ZKP asset for a private asset, using a custom Atom (atomic transaction) contract. Zeto is used for the ZKP asset, and Noto for the private asset, with Pente for the private logic.

See the [tutorial](https://lf-decentralized-trust-labs.github.io/paladin/head/tutorials/atomic-swap/) for a detailed explanation.
