# Paladin Examples Development Guide

This guide outlines the process for developing Paladin examples and the requirements that all examples must meet.

## Overview

All Paladin examples must follow a consistent pattern that includes:

1. **Data Persistence**: Saving contract data to files for later verification
2. **Verification Scripts**: Ensuring deployed contracts remain accessible and functional
3. **Standard Commands**: Providing consistent npm scripts across all examples
4. **Documentation**: Clear README with setup and verification instructions

## Required Structure

Every example must have the following structure:

```
examples/your-example/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              # Main example implementation
│   ├── tests/
│   │   └── data-persistence.ts    # Data persistence verification script (REQUIRED)
│   └── abis/                 # Contract ABIs
├── package.json              # Required scripts
├── README.md                 # Clear instruction for running the example
└── tsconfig.json
```

## About the Tests Folder

The `tests/` folder within each example contains verification scripts that ensure that the data persistence and contract deployment aspects of examples work correctly.

> **Note**: Users are not expected to run these tests as part of learning Paladin. They are included within each example folder because they directly test that specific example's functionality, making the relationship clear and logical.

## Required npm Scripts

Every example's `package.json` should include these scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "ts-node ./src/index.ts",
    "start:prod": "node ./build/index.js",
    "verify": "ts-node ./src/tests/data-persistence.ts",
    "abi": "node scripts/abi.mjs",
    "copy-abi": "node scripts/contracts.mjs"
  }
}
```

### Script Descriptions

- **`start`**: Run the example with ts-node
- **`start:prod`**: Run the example with built JavaScript
- **`verify`**: Run verification with ts-node
- **`abi`**: Copy ABIs from the solidity directory (this is for the scenario the solidity was built locally)
- **`copy-abi`**: Copy ABIs from examples/common to example directory
