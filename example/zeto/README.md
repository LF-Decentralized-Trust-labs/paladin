# Example: ZKP Fungible Tokens with Zeto

This example demonstrates a privacy-preserving fungible tokens using [Zeto](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/zeto) on Paladin.

See the [tutorial](https://lf-decentralized-trust-labs.github.io/paladin/head/tutorials/zkp-cbdc/) for a detailed explanation.

## Pre-requisites

### Local Paladin network

This sample requires a local 3-node Paladin network running on `localhost:31548`, `localhost:31648`, and `localhost:31748`. You can get one setup by running the operator build:

```console
(from the paladin root folder)
$ ./gradlew :operator:deploy
```

This should provision a local kubernetes (based on Kind) cluster and provision a Besu and Paladin network including these pods:

```console
$ kubectl get po
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
besu-node1-0                       1/1     Running   0          19m
besu-node2-0                       1/1     Running   0          19m
besu-node3-0                       1/1     Running   0          19m
paladin-node1-0                    2/2     Running   0          17m
paladin-node2-0                    2/2     Running   0          17m
paladin-node3-0                    2/2     Running   0          17m
paladin-operator-bc788db4f-mzbs7   1/1     Running   0          19m
```

### ABI resources for Zeto

The sample uses the following ABIs to accomplish the end to end flow:

- IZetoFungible.json: private transaction ABI for the Zeto domain, to conduct private transactions like `mint`, `transfer`, `lock`, etc.
- Zeto_Anon.json: public transaction ABI for the Zeto token implementation, to conduct public transactions "delegateLock`
- SampleERC20.json: public transaction ABI for a sample ERC20 token, to conduct public transactions to mint ERC20 tokens

These dependency resources can be obtained by running the following builds:

```console
$ ./gradlew :sdk:typescript:build
$ ./gradlew :example:zeto:build
```

## Run the example

Run the example with the following command from inside the `example/zeto` folder:

```console
cd example/zeto
npm install
npm run start
